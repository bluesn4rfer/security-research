# Week 2 â€“ Templates & XSS labs (completed)

## Overview
This week I focused on establishing a repeatable documentation workflow and completing hands-on XSS labs. I created standardized templates for lab reports and weekly notes, completed an initial reflected XSS lab, and finished a stored XSS lab that required additional tooling troubleshooting.

---

## Labs Completed
- [Reflected XSS into HTML context with nothing encoded](../labs/portswigger_reflected_xss_no_encoding/report.md)  
Confirmed a reflected XSS condition by injecting a simple `<script>` payload that was echoed by the page and resulted in execution when rendered. Identified the vulnerable input point and validated execution.

- [Stored XSS into HTML context with nothing encoded](../labs/portswigger_stored_xss_no_encoding/report.md)  
Demonstrated a stored XSS scenario where a `<script>` payload submitted via the comment form was saved and later executed when the comment was displayed. Reproduced the issue via captured browser submission (to preserve the CSRF token and session).

## Key Takeaways
- XSS works when untrusted input is reflected into HTML without escaping.
- Even a basic script injection confirms the vulnerability.
- Having templates makes lab reporting and weekly notes much faster and more consistent.

---

## Progress Toward Goals
- âœ… Completed first PortSwigger XSS lab.
- âœ… Created reusable templates for lab reports and weekly notes.
- ðŸ”œ Continue working through the XSS lab series.  

---

## Reflections
Getting the first lab done felt straightforward, but setting up reusable templates gave me a big confidence boost for keeping everything organized long-term.

---

## Next Steps
- Finish additional reflected and stored XSS labs.
- Expand lab documentation with screenshots and solution notes.
- Continue refining my workflow as needed.
