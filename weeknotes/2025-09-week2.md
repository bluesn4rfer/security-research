# Week 2 â€“ Laying the Foundation

## Overview
This week I completed my first XSS lab and established a repeatable structure for future documentation. I created standardized templates for lab reports and weekly notes to keep progress clear and professional.

---

## Labs Completed
- [Reflected XSS into HTML context with nothing encoded](../labs/portswigger_reflected_xss_no_encoding/report.md)  
This lab demonstrated how reflected input can be executed in the browser when echoed without sanitization. I solved it by injecting a simple `<script>` payload and confirming execution.

---

## Key Takeaways
- XSS works when untrusted input is reflected into HTML without escaping.
- Even a basic script injection confirms the vulnerability.
- Having templates makes lab reporting and weekly notes much faster and more consistent.

---

## Progress Toward Goals
- âœ… Completed first PortSwigger XSS lab.
- âœ… Created reusable templates for lab reports and weekly notes.
- ðŸ”œ Continue working through the XSS lab series.  

---

## Reflections
Getting the first lab done felt straightforward, but setting up reusable templates gave me a big confidence boost for keeping everything organized long-term.

---

## Next Steps
- Finish additional reflected and stored XSS labs.
- Expand lab documentation with screenshots and solution notes.
- Continue refining my workflow as needed.
